# Markdown for Gmail Chrome Extension

This extension allows you to write emails in Markdown when composing a message in Gmail. Convert the Markdown to rich text via the provided context menu item or with the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+M`.

An options page allows you to configure automatic conversion on paste, parser settings, emoji support, and a custom keyboard shortcut. The shortcut string recognizes `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, and `cmd`/`meta` tokens so macOS users can specify combinations like `cmd+shift+m`. When you save a new shortcut it is applied to the extension's command automatically, so there is no need to update it through the **Extension shortcuts** page.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and choose this folder.

## Usage
- Compose a new email in Gmail and write it using Markdown syntax.
- Right-click inside the editable area and choose **Convert Markdown to Rich Text**, or press `Ctrl+Shift+M`.
- Use **Convert HTML to Markdown** from the context menu (or `Ctrl+Shift+H`) to reverse the conversion in Gmail.
- The extension converts the Markdown to rich text within the compose area and can convert existing HTML back to Markdown when requested.
- Emoji shortcodes like `:smile:` are automatically converted to their corresponding characters.
- Choose between *clean*, *Notion-style*, or *email-friendly* themes for rendered Markdown.
- Typing `/note` or `/table` expands to a blockquote or table template.

## Development
The conversion is performed using the [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) library which is bundled inside `injector.js`.
